# About IPv6

# Why do we need IPv6
- The depletion of IPv4 is one of the main reasons why we need IPv6, which provides around 340 undecillion unique addresses.
- The introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) poses a serious threat on the depletion of IPv4 as devices i.e smart TVs, refrigerator can access the internet.
- Also, IPv6 is designed to address IPv4 limitations e.g  NAT issues which breaks end-to-end connectivity and creates latency on applications.
