# Network Documentation

Network documentation helps to monitor and troubleshoot a network easily, and should always be complete and accurate.

A network documentation can include logical and physical network topology diagram:
 - **Logical Network diagram** shows how information is flowing throughout a network. This includes the IPs, subnets, routers, and routing protocols. 

 - **Physical Network diagram** reveals how devices are stored in a physical location, this can be their building number, floors, rooms even rack numbers.

**A network performance baseline should also be documented.**
 - A network baseline is used to reveal how network performs under normal conditions. It assigns the network a personality that can give us insights on how new changes (i.e new devices, temperature conditions) affect the network.
 - The data of the performance can be obtained from ports and essential devices in the network operation.
 - The baseline data also provides insight on whether the current network design can meet business requirements.

**Main documentation and backup documentation must be kept in different locations. Furthermore, all documentations should contain up-to date and accurate information of network hardware and software, with all other necessary information**
